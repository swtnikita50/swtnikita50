Hello There! I am Nikita Sehrawat, a final year dual degree student looking for PhD opportunities in the field of astrodyanmcis and satellite missions design. I am majoring in Aerospace engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. My research interests are:
- MutiBody Dynamical systems
- Space Mission Design, Trajectory Optimization, Dynamics around Small Bodies
- Spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control, Satellite Constellations
- Space Situational Awareness, Space Debris Removal and Collision Avoidance

Let me walk you through some of the stuff I do around here.

## [CR3BPLibrary](https://github.com/swtnikita50/CRTBP-Library)

CR3BPLibrary: This is a library for the circular-restricted three-body gravitational problem fully coded in Matlab. It can be used to generate various jacobi senesitive lyapunov orbits, halor obits and their invariant manifolds. These functionalities can be used to delepo a mission in a simple CR3BP system. You can perform bifurcation studies as well using this library. Some of the newer functionalities of this library will be adding new orbits of the system. Some of the results generated using this library is given here.

One cool fact: NASA has carried out a space misson named GENESIS based on these concepts.

Amazing Stuff it can do:

The Red Star you see here represents the moon and these are spacecraft Trajectories. Pretty cool orbits right!
Check out the repo readme to understand how to generate them. And who knows you will get interested in the problem too. 

## [astrodynamics](https://github.com/swtnikita50/astrodynamics)
This repositary contains some of the codes I develop while trying out new concepts in astrodynamics. This space constains two projects as of now:
1) PorkChop Pplot
2) Particle Swarm Optimization implementation for generating Lyapunov Orbit and Halo Orbits.


## [Gravity Assist Analysis](https://github.com/swtnikita50/GravityAssist)
GravityAssistAnalysis: Well this is just the start of the work. Gravity Assists made the Voyager missions 1 and 2 a success. Well before introducing gravity Assists into the mission profile (the program named Grand Tour) the cost was around **1 billion dollors** and Well its safe to say now, was PRETTAAAAY HUGE in 1970's.

So if a method can make impossible things possible it's for sure worth stuyding!

## [3-Body Problem](https://github.com/swtnikita50/3-Body-Problem)
3-Body Problem: This repo contains my implementation of the paper on Dynamics near a binary astroid system.

## [CodeBrewers2020](https://github.com/swtnikita50/Code_Brewers2020)
CodeBrewers2020: This is the project my team carried out during codess-2020 mentorship program organised by microsoft. It hosts a PathFinding webpage, which implements various pathfinding algorithms. 

Also one cool fact: Our team won 4th position among 600+ participants at the end of the project. Also the website itself is so AWESOME! Visit it sometime.

## [scholasticreplica](https://github.com/swtnikita50/scholasticreplica)
scholasticreplica: This is just a project I carried out while learning HTML and CSS for webD and it turned out well good.

## [mywebsite](https://github.com/swtnikita50/mywebsite)
mywebsite: This space will host my personal website (with my personal blogs, and webd projects, some very cool animations, space mission deisgns, dancing and some crazy stuff as I will explore more), but well is under construction at the moment.
