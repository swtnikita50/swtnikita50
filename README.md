First of all, Ignore my username, (made you check it I know!) my cousin made my gmail account and well you know how cousins are...
Although If you don't I am jealous of you!

![who-the-hell-is-ohhhh-yeahhh-hello-to-you-too](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49591523/178698724-4224640d-788b-44b1-a217-b62499576582.gif)

But anyway, Lets get started!
So first let's meet the owner of this profile i.e. OBVIOUSLY ME. OHHMAHHGOD WHY ARE YOU SO DUMB!

Enough about me, lets move ahead. So I do most of the cool stuff around here, like

## [CR3BPLibrary](https://github.com/swtnikita50/CRTBP-Library)

CR3BPLibrary: that I have built is SOOOO PRECIOUS. This is mostly a library for the circular-restricted three-body gravitational problem, but its not important to be a researcher or engineer to enjoy this library. 

Ofcourse you need to be one of those to make changes to this, but hey you can use it to generate interesting patterns. And Who doesn't love cool patterns with an application to outer space.

WHAAAAAAAA! 

Yeah these crazy orbits have an application to outer space as well (some applications to chemistry are also there, but more on that on another day). 

One cool fact: NASA has carried out a space misson named GENESIS based on these concepts.

Amaze Stuff it can do:

![LyapOrbitInvariantManifold](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49591523/178713606-cfda4403-0a6b-4e17-bed0-0b9d7710a47a.png)

The Red Star you see here represents the moon and these are spacecraft Trajectories. Pretty cool orbits right!
Check out the repo readme to understand how to generate them. And who knows you will get interested in the problem too. 


## [Gravity Assist Analysis](https://github.com/swtnikita50/GravityAssist)
GravityAssistAnalysis: Well this is just the start of the work. Gravity Assists are so cool and this concept made the Voyager missions 1 and 2 a success. Well before introducing gravity Assists into the mission profile (the program named Grand Tour) the cost was around **1 billion dollors** and Well its safe to say now, was PRETTAAAAY HUGE in 1970's.

So if a method can make impossible things possible it's for sure worth stuyding!

## [3-Body Problem](https://github.com/swtnikita50/3-Body-Problem)
3-Body Problem: So, this code makes use of the 3-body problem, for sure but dont confuse it with the 1st one. Cause here we use Patched-3Body Dynamics to study the DYNAMICS NEAR A BINARY ASTEROID SYSTEM. Cool! Right?

## [CodeBrewers2020](https://github.com/swtnikita50/Code_Brewers2020)
CodeBrewers2020: This is the project my team carried out during codess-2020 mentorship program organised by microsoft. It hosts a PathFinding webpage, which implements various pathfinding algorithms. 

Also one cool fact: Our team won 4th position among 500+ participants at the end of the project. Also the website itself is so AWESOME! Visit it sometime.

## [scholasticreplica](https://github.com/swtnikita50/scholasticreplica)
scholasticreplica: This is just a project I carried out while learning HTML and CSS for webD and it turned out well good.

## [mywebsite](https://github.com/swtnikita50/mywebsite)
mywebsite: So... **BEHOLD, FOR THE MIGHTY... MY WEBSITE!**. Well not exacty ready yet. hehe. This **will** host my personal website (with my personal blogs, and webd projects, some very cool animations, space mission deisgns, dancing and some crazy stuff as I will explore more), but well is under construction at the moment.
